  <p>Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser
    whose 'sourmug' face is the universal symbol of courage and tenacity. These docile, loyal companions adapt
    well to town or country.</p>
  <p class='special'>You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow,
    phed-in nose,
    small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all
    practically scream 'I'm a Bulldog!' The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth,
    and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at
    least trying to. But don't mistake their easygoing ways for laziness'Bulldogs enjoy brisk walks and need
    regular moderate exercise, along with a careful diet, to stay trim. Summer afternoons are best spent in an
    air-conditioned room as a Bulldog's short snout can cause labored breathing in hot and humid weather.</p>
