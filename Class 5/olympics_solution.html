      The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques)[1][2] are
      leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports
      competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world
      participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered
      the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations
      participating.[3] The Olympic Games are normally held every four years,
      alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the
      four-year period.
    </p>

    <p>
      Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek:
      Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the
      4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International
      Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in
      Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic
      Movement[definition needed], with the Olympic Charter defining its
      structure and authority.
    </p>

    <p>
      The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries
      has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these
      adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and
      ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth
      Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games (Pan
      American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for
      sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses
      the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has needed to adapt to a
      variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse
      of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift
      away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance
      of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing
      importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship
      and general commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the
      cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts
      during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984
      Olympics;[4] and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 as a result
      of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs),
      National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each
      specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is
      responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and
      funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines
      the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the
      Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic
      flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 14,000
      athletes competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics
      combined, in 35 different sports and over 400 events.[5][6] The first,
      second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals:
      gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented.
      This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including
      boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years
      the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to
      attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also provide
      an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the
      world.
