    <p>The sweet-faced, lovable Labrador Retriever is America's most popular dog breed. Labs are friendly,
      outgoing,
      and high-spirited companions who have more than enough affection to go around for a family looking for a
      medium-to-large dog.</p>
    <p>The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at
      the
      shoulder and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in yellow, black, and a luscious
      chocolate. The head is wide, the eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering 'otter tail' seems to
      be
      forever signaling the breed's innate eagerness. Labs are famously friendly. They are companionable
      housemates
      who bond with the whole family, and they socialize well with neighbor dogs and humans alike. But don't
      mistake
      his easygoing personality for low energy: The Lab is an enthusiastic athlete that requires lots of exercise,
      like swimming and marathon games of fetch, to keep physically and mentally fit.</p>
      <p>Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile,
        muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German
        Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.</p>
      <p> German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents
        a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they
        can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds. There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in
        the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage,
        confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line
        in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the
        breed standard says, there's a 'certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate
        friendships.</p>
