      <p class="firstp">Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club in Liverpool, England, that competes in the Premier
        League, the top tier of English football. Domestically, the club has won nineteen League titles, seven FA Cups,
        a record eight League Cups and fifteen FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six
        European Cups, more than any other English club, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups (also English records)
        and one FIFA Club World Cup.</p>

      <p>Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played at Anfield since its
        formation. Liverpool established itself as a major force in English and European football in the 1970s and
        1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish led the club to a combined eleven League
        titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of
        Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a nineteenth League title in 2020,
        the club's first during the Premier League era.</p>

      <p>Liverpool is one of the most widely supported clubs in the world, as well as one of the most valuable.
        Liverpool has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. The team changed from red shirts and
        white shorts to an all-red home strip in 1964 which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "You'll Never
        Walk Alone".</p>

      <p>The club's supporters have been involved in two major tragedies. The Heysel Stadium disaster, where escaping
        fans were pressed against a collapsing wall at the 1985 European Cup Final in Brussels, resulted in 39 deaths.
        Most of these were Italians and Juventus fans, and English clubs were given a five-year ban from European
        competition as a result. The Hillsborough disaster in 1989, where 97 Liverpool supporters died in a crush
        against perimeter fencing, led to the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all-seater stadiums
        in the top two tiers of English football.</p>
